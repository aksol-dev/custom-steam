# What does the skin hide?
If a feature is not default but you would like to use it, you have to uncomment the corresponding line in ```resource/webkit.css```.
If a feature is striked through that means it is currently not working.

- Hides the 'Whats New' section in the library.
- Hides the 'Add Showcase' button on your profile.
- Hides all the recent games on every profile.
- **(Not default)** Shows just 1 recent game instead of 3 on every profile.
- Hides art showcases everywhere to avoid those 'transparent' steam profiles.
- Hides every profile's ban status.
- **(Not default)** Hides the title of every showcase.
- **(Not default)** Hides the item count on every item showcase.
- Hides the spotlight section (The nagging bar asking for a review on the game page).
- Hides the post activity text submit bar on the game page.
- Hides the info section alert of a non-steam game.
- Hides the 'New in Library' banner on newly added games.
- ~~Hides the asterisk next to a nicknamed friend.~~
- Hides the 'How to get card drops' link on every badge row.
- Hides the play button on every badge row.
- ~~Hides level 0 badges when you have no cards from that collection.~~
- Hides the warning icon on item thumbnails in inventory.
- Hides the 'recently updated' section of the store.
- Hides the 'currently live streaming' section of the store.
- Hide the livestream on the product page. (NOTE: You also need to disable product streams in steam preferences)

# Editing the skin
I tried to make the skin as editable as possible, to edit this go to the ```webkit.css``` file located in the ```resource``` folder.
In this file you can remove the lines (or comment them out) that you don't need.
