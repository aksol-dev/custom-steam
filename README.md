# Custom Steam skin

This skin hides certain aspects of the Steam client that I dislike.

## Notes
Remove lines in webkit.css that you don't need.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the GitHub page on the right.
2. Drag and drop the folder ```custom-steam``` inside ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins```.

> You can create the folder 'skins' if this doesn't exist.

3. Start/restart Steam.
4. Steam settings -> Interface -> Select the skin you wish Steam to use (requires Steam to restart). 
5. Select ```custom-steam```.
6. Restart Steam.

## (Developer notes) Creating a release

> It's important to keep this structure so that the installation instructions will always work.

1. Zip the ```resource``` folder.
2. Rename the zip file to 'custom-steam.zip'.
3. Upload zip as a new release.
